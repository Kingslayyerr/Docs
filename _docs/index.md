## Intro

A beginner friendly introduction to using Git version control through the **GitHub Desktop** application. Users will be able to create new **repositories**, **clone** existing repositories to a local development environment, **add** new files to a repo(make changes), create a **commit**, make comments on the commit, make a **new branch**, **push** the changes to GitHub, make a **pull request**, **merge** changes, and delete the created branch. Slightly more advanced users will also learn how to **fork** an **open source** repo,and make branches and pull requests for proposed changes to a real software project.

## Pre-requisites

* Create a GitHub account at github.com
* Familiarity with a Text Editor such as Sublime or Atom
